# Resize Images

This repository is aimed at a specific project. However, it could possibly be used for other projects.

## Overview
The goal here is to simply resize multiple images from multiple directories.

The ```main.py``` (and ```main.ipynb```) assume that the following directory structure exists starting in its own directory: images -> input (or output) -> directories that contain images -> image files.

You will most likely have to edit the file, particular the ```set_variables()``` function, to reflect your own file paths.

## Instructions
1) Create and activate virtual environment
2) Install dependencies from the requirements.txt file. For example: ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3) Edit the ```main.py``` (or ```main.ipynb```) file to reflect your use case, especially the ```set_variables()``` function.
4) Run the Python script.
